# Heterogeneously-Roughened-Series60-Catamaran-OpenFOAM-Simulation
This repository showcases a simulation from my research projects.

This simulation is part of an array of simulations aimed at answering 
the specific question: Which part of a catamaran experiences more added 
resistance due to surface roughening 
â€” the inner surface or the outer surface?

It was performed at Fn 0.40, s/L 0.388, Fixed Trim and 
outer half of the catamarans surface roughened to level of
medium calcareous fouling (Ks = 3000e-06).

Thank you !!!
